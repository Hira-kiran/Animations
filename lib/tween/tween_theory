Animations
Tween Animation
This is in-between animation. 3 things are required in this, starting point, ending point and duration.
For this we need Animation, AnimationController and SingleTickerProviderStateMixin then we achieve tween animation

No need for any third party package


we use animatedController.addListener() for update animation value
and we use animationController.forward() for start animation



for shown it in UI , we need to use setstate((){})


we also apply tween animation on color, same proccess make controller and animation also SingleTickerProviderStateMixin, but in the place of Tween we need to use ColorTween. 
But if we already use Tween in our project then we just need to make animation that is   late Animation colorAnimation; no need to make controller,just use the controller that we make for tween.
